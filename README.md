# Design_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_modeling_XOR_gate

The repository contains the implementation of a logical XOR gate using a neural network with a single hidden layer. The neural network architecture and weights are designed to achieve XOR functionality. The repository provides code, explanations, and visualizations to help understand the process.
